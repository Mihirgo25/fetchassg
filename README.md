# Javascript Fetch Assignment

1. I did not implement delete and edit via clicking on the list item. Instead, I used id as my reference to delete and edit the item. As it is very convinient to delete it that way.
2. I also implemented the reset button to undo the most recent edit.(It was not even in optional but felt like it's nice to have.)
3. There are few of the difficulties I faced.

   a. Subtasks: I tried to solve the subtasks but it was difficult to correlate each task with multiple subtasks. I did not add subtasks and the functionalities related to subtask.

   b. Due Date Auto complete: As mentioned by Prabjyyot sir, I tried to use Keyboard events to create autocomplete but I was facing some difficulties.

   c. Remainder: I found it difficult to create remainders for the certain tasks whose duedate was closer.
